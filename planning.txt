I am creating an etch a sketch web app that will be deployed on github pages 

This is a project given by the odin project btw, all the code is made by me however. 


----------------------------------------------------------------
Goals:


1. set up a 24x12 gird of square divs, 
    give the user three options with 24x12 being small, 48x24 being medium, and 96x48 being large 

    Put these gird squares inside a container div that I will later create but the divs should be made using JS as it will give me more progress 

    set up hover effect so that the grid divs change color when my mouse passes over them. (create this effect via enviornment listener and changing the background color)

2. nessescary 

    color mode: when selected allows me to click an icon to change the RGB value of my pen 

    have the pen motion note only be on hover but be on CLICK HOLD and HOVERING

3. bonus functions

    create an effect that randomizes the squares RGB value with each interation 

    implement a progressive darkening effect function where each intereaction darkens the square by 10%

    create an eraser that erases over those squares when hovered ( return it back to the white canvas)



the design of the website: 

    lets make this like an actually etch-a-sketch from toy story lol 

    header will be at the top within the red border surronding the page. 
    and probably like a pastel color to fill the rest of the page 

    the grid boxes would be white 

    footer will be at the bottom of the page (duh)

    grid density options will come first. 


    color mode (will be double click to change color), random/rainbow mode, darkening effect will all be the bottom next to mode

    eraser, clear board, and toggle gird will be at the very bottom 


color palette: 

    red: e5383b
    yellow: ffba08
    beige(to make the red pop): f9dcc4 (might change later)

    font: @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=VT323&display=swap');

step 1: 

    set up the html strucute of this webpage
